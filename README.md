# upload-rate-limiter

This application is a Node.js API designed to simulate rate limiting of file uploads. Unlike standard request-counting rate limiting, this API limits upload rate based on request size.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/ethandjay/upload-rate-limiter
cd upload-rate-limiter
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

Start the application, and in a separate shell, run:
```
npm test
```
